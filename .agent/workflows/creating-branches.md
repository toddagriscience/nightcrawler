description: When creating branches for a task or issue
---

1. Ensure an **Issue** exists before starting work.
2. Create a new branch on GitHub once assigned or picking up an issue. 
3. Follow repository-specific naming conventions (e.g., `{conventional-commit}/{short-summary}` in this repo).
4. Maintain the standard development flow: **Issue -> Branch -> PR -> Merge to preferred branch**.
5. Keep the issue status and attributes updated as the branch progresses.
6. Follow repository guidelines for contributing when preparing the branch for a PR. All PRs should link issues.
