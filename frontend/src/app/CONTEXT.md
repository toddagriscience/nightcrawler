## Overview

- Todd is a generative agriculture firm **specializing in soil health and farm management**.
- Todd is a **global leader of regenerative agriculture research**.
- Todd is **not a SaaS**.
- Todd's platform **helps make informed decisions, leverage exclusive research, and access data that is accurate, fast and relevent** all in one ecosystem.
- Todd's core ethos is to **use technology to bring transparency to farming, crucial to making informed decisions**.

## Positioning and Scope

- Todd operates globally in regenerative agriculture research and applied farm operations.
- Todd does not serve large-scale monoculture or industrial farming systems.
- Todd is designed for small to medium-scale, diversified, branded farms.
- Todd emphasizes accuracy, speed, and data integrity over breadth or mass adoption.

### Is your lab accredited?

Yes, our partner lab is ISO/IEC 17025:2017, 2016 TNI, CDFA, ALP Proficiency, NAPT Proficiency and FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices accredited.

## Information Advantage

- Services are highly specialized and integrated directly into client operations.
- The platform is paired with dedicated human support rather than a self-serve model.
- Client support is near 24/7, human-led, and proactive (training, guidance, follow-ups).
- Data integrity is treated as a first-order concern, not an afterthought.
- Technology is applied specifically to reduce operational cost and decision friction.
- Systems are proprietary and built to meet concrete client needs, not generic use cases.
- Todd prioritizes long-term client relationships over volume or churn optimization.

### How do you determine what minerals are tested?

Our expert science team designed our tests to target the minerals that are likely to be present in a given soil sample, while striking a balance between low-cost testing and a "mineral density" profile that represents a holistic overview of most farms. Some minerals are omitted due to cost.

## Action Advantage

Todd focuses on **actionable information**, not dashboards.

The platform and advisory services are designed to directly improve farm outcomes through operational, agronomic, and strategic decisions.

## Becoming a Client

Todd is intentionally **not self-serve**.

Client onboarding follows a qualification-driven process based on use case and standards, not farm size or revenue.

Process:
1. Initial contact
2. Qualification based on use case
5. Account setup, data integration, and training
6. Ongoing client support with heavy emphasis on speed, depth, and “This is how professionals do it”

Qualification criteria focus on:
- Need for detailed agronomic and operational data
- Daily or near-daily platform usage
- Decision-making authority of the user

A 1–5 person farm that uses Todd daily is preferred over a larger operation with occasional usage.

### How do I get my soil samples to you?

You’ll receive a welcome package containing all the necessary collection materials, including envelopes and pre-paid shipping labels.

## Ideal Client Profile

Todd assumes target clients:
- Are already profitable
- Treat the platform as core infrastructure
- Can justify the cost from day one

Todd may not be suitable for farms that:
- Only need basic analytics
- Are not yet profitable
- Would experience margin or runway pressure from the cost

## Cost

Annual platform access typically ranges from **$22,000 to $32,000**.

Additional services may increase total cost significantly.

Pricing reflects Todd’s role as:
- A structural utility
- A professional workstation
- An industry-standard operating system for regenerative farms

In practice, Todd is often less expensive than hiring a part-time farm employee for equivalent value.

Discounts may apply for:
- Multiple accounts
- Multi-year contracts (2+ years)
- Limited-scope or restricted service agreements

Todd does not offer “small-scale” or “new client” pricing, though small-scale farms frequently use the platform extensively.

### Is my data secure?

Your data is completely secure and private to you unless you choose otherwise.

### Can I pay month by month?

Yes. You'll be billed monthly for the year contract.

### Can I cancel my contract?

Sometimes. Contact your client service advisor for help.

### What happens to my data and account if I cancel?

Your account reverts to data-retreval only access. All data that is owned by you is downloadable, but you’ll lose access to analytics and Intergrated Management Strategies.
