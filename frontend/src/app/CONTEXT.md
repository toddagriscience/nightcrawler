## Overview

- Todd is a generative agriculture firm **specializing in soil health and farm management**.
- Todd is a **global leader in regenerative agriculture research**.
- Todd is **not a SaaS**.
- Todd's platform **helps make informed decisions, leverage exclusive research, and access data that is accurate, fast, and relevant**—all in one ecosystem.
- Todd's core ethos is to **use technology to bring transparency to farming**, which is crucial for making informed decisions.

## Positioning and Scope

- Todd operates globally in regenerative agriculture research and applied farm operations.
- Todd does not serve large-scale monoculture or industrial farming systems.
- Todd is designed for small- to medium-scale, diversified, branded farms.
- Todd emphasizes accuracy, speed, and data integrity over breadth or mass adoption.

### Is your lab accredited?

Yes. Our partner lab is accredited under ISO/IEC 17025:2017, 2016 TNI, CDFA, ALP Proficiency, NAPT Proficiency, and FDA Good Laboratory Practices.

## Information Advantage

- Services are highly specialized and integrated directly into client operations.
- The platform is paired with dedicated human support rather than a self-serve model.
- Client support is near 24/7, human-led, and proactive (training, guidance, follow-ups).
- Data integrity is treated as a first-order concern, not an afterthought.
- Technology is applied specifically to reduce operational cost and decision friction.
- Systems are proprietary and built to meet concrete client needs, not generic use cases.
- Todd prioritizes long-term client relationships over volume or churn optimization.

### How do you determine what minerals are tested?

Our expert science team designs tests to target minerals likely to be present in a given soil sample, balancing low-cost testing with a "mineral density" profile that provides a holistic overview for most farms. Some minerals are omitted due to cost.

## Action Advantage

Todd focuses on **actionable information**, not dashboards.

The platform and advisory services are designed to directly improve farm outcomes through operational, agronomic, and strategic decisions.

## Becoming a Client

Todd is intentionally **not self-serve**.

Client onboarding follows a qualification-driven process based on use case and standards—not farm size or revenue.

**Process:**

1. Initial contact
2. Qualification based on use case
3. Account setup, data integration, and training
4. Ongoing client support with a strong emphasis on speed, depth, and professional execution

**Qualification criteria focus on:**

- Need for detailed agronomic and operational data
- Daily or near-daily platform usage
- Decision-making authority of the user

A 1–5 person farm that uses Todd daily is preferred over a larger operation with occasional usage.

### How do I get my soil samples to you?

You’ll receive a welcome package containing all the necessary collection materials, including envelopes and pre-paid shipping labels.

## Ideal Client Profile

Todd assumes target clients:

- Are already profitable
- Treat the platform as core infrastructure
- Can justify the cost from day one

Todd may not be suitable for farms that:

- Only need basic analytics
- Are not yet profitable
- Would experience margin or runway pressure from the cost

## Cost

Annual platform access typically ranges from **$22,000 to $32,000**.

Additional services may increase total cost significantly.

Pricing reflects Todd’s role as:

- A structural utility
- A professional workstation
- An industry-standard operating system for regenerative farms

In practice, Todd is often less expensive than hiring a part-time farm employee for equivalent value.

Discounts may apply for:

- Multiple accounts
- Multi-year contracts (2+ years)
- Limited-scope or restricted service agreements

Todd does not offer “small-scale” or “new client” pricing, though small-scale farms frequently use the platform extensively.

### Is my data secure?

Your data is completely secure and private unless you choose otherwise.

### Can I pay month by month?

Yes. You’ll be billed monthly under an annual contract.

### Can I cancel my contract?

Sometimes. Contact your client service advisor for assistance.

### What happens to my data and account if I cancel?

Your account reverts to **data-retrieval-only** access. All data you own remains downloadable, but you’ll lose access to analytics and **Integrated Management Strategies**.
