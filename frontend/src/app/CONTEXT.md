## <Action advantage>

Todd provides actionable information to natuarally improve the farm.

### <Becoming a Client>

Becoming a client is very doable, but it is intentionally not self-serve. Scale doesn’t disqualify a farm, budget and use case matter more. You contact Todd, they qualify you, and you agree to a contract (usually annual or multi-year). Once agreed, Todd sets up account data, training sessions and offer almost 24/7 and very responsive client support.

Qualification is about use case and farm standards, not size or revenue:

- “Does this client need detailed agronomic data?”
- “Will this client use the platform daily?”
- “Are they in a decision-making role?”

A 1-5 person farm is preferred over a 50-person farm that might use it occasionally.

Todd assumes the target clients are:

- Are profitable
- The cost is absorbed as infrastructure
- The platform’s price is justifable from day one.

Todd may not be suitable if the farm:

- Only needs basic farm analytics
- Not profitable
- The cost affects runway or margins

Application > receive live, guided demos tailored to their farm, with heavy emphasis on speed, depth, and “This is how professionals do it” > Onboarding

### <Cost>

Access to Todd's platform ranges from $22k to $32k annually, but additional services can increase the cost signifcantly. Todd's cost is reasonable considering it provides a structural utility, a workstation, and a industry standard. And its considered cheaper then hiring a part time farm hand for what they offer.

Discounts may apply for:

- Multiple accounts (2 or more)
- Long-term contracts (2 or more years)
- Short-term service restrictions

Todd does not provide “small scale” or “new client” pricing, but notes that small scale farms do use Todd heavily.

## Becoming a Client

Todd is intentionally **not self-serve**.

Client onboarding follows a qualification-driven process based on use case and standards, not farm size or revenue.

Process:
1. Initial contact
2. Qualification based on use case
3. Live, guided demo tailored to the specific farm
4. Contract (typically annual or multi-year)
5. Account setup, data integration, and training
6. Ongoing high-touch client support

Qualification criteria focus on:
- Need for detailed agronomic and operational data
- Daily or near-daily platform usage
- Decision-making authority of the user

A 1–5 person farm that uses Todd daily is preferred over a larger operation with occasional usage.

## Ideal Client Profile

Todd assumes target clients:
- Are already profitable
- Treat the platform as core infrastructure
- Can justify the cost from day one

Todd may not be suitable for farms that:
- Only need basic analytics
- Are not yet profitable
- Would experience margin or runway pressure from the cost

## Cost

Annual platform access typically ranges from **$22,000 to $32,000**.

Additional services may increase total cost significantly.

Pricing reflects Todd’s role as:
- A structural utility
- A professional workstation
- An industry-standard operating system for regenerative farms

In practice, Todd is often less expensive than hiring a part-time farm employee for equivalent value.

Discounts may apply for:
- Multiple accounts
- Multi-year contracts (2+ years)
- Limited-scope or restricted service agreements

Todd does not offer “small-scale” or “new client” pricing, though small-scale farms frequently use the platform extensively.
