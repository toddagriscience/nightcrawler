Real, physical, proprietary data that characterizes soil, generates actionable practices, and gigabytes of data that exist nowhere else.",

We deploy location-specific resources to farms everywhere, from renowned coastal areas to mountainous hollows— driving measurable impact and propelling a virtuous cycle of improved soil quality and healthier produce."
