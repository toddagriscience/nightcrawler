(I'm still working on this. I need to push this now.)

Todd is a generative agriculture firm focusing on soil helth, farm management and consumer engagement for small to medium scale organic, biodyanmic and regenerative farms. 

To make informed decisions, farms need data, news and research that is accurate, fast and relevant. And they need special technology to analyze risk, find the best opportunities, and . Todd puts all of this into one ecosystem. Todd’s core ethos is to use technology to bring transparency to farming, allowing farms to see the data  . That transparency is crucial to making informed decisions. Make good choices.

Global domination to food production.

Todd is not a SaaS.

## <Information advantage>


Can we apply technology to make to cut down costs, at the same time, provide the best client experience so you just don’t have any reason to leave. You have plenty of reasons to join us, but Todd services and products can serve you better on platform and you shouldn’t need to look elsewhere for services or products.

Todd is extremely proactive about platform data integrity.

We emphasize seamless front-to-back services to the world’s most important agriculture producers via proprietary systems built to meet specific client needs for high-demand, low-latency data access. Instead of a self-service portal, the focus is on direct relationships and dedicated support from the client advisory teams. Information about specific operations, data or customized analytics would be delivered through the platform.

Our services are highly specialized and directly integrated with the operations of our clients.

Todd client support is known as being legendary. Almost 24/7 human response and proactive training.

It’s for small and medium scale diversified farms, not large scale monoculture 

## <Action advantage>

Todd provides actionable information to natuarally improve the farm.

### <Becoming a Client>

Becoming a client is very doable, but it is intentionally not self-serve. Scale doesn’t disqualify a farm, budget and use case matter more. You contact Todd, they qualify you, and you agree to a contract (usually annual or multi-year). Once agreed, Todd sets up account data, training sessions and offer almost 24/7 and very responsive client support.

Qualification is about use case and farm standards, not size or revenue:

- “Does this client need detailed agronomic data?”
- “Will this client use the platform daily?”
- “Are they in a decision-making role?”

A 1-5 person farm is preferred over a 50-person farm that might use it occasionally.

Todd assumes the target clients are:

- Are profitable
- The cost is absorbed as infrastructure
- The platform’s price is justifable from day one.

Todd may not be suitable if the farm:

- Only needs basic farm analytics
- Not profitable
- The cost affects runway or margins

### <Cost>

Access to Todd's platform ranges from $22k to $32k annually, but additional services can increase the cost signifcantly. Todd's cost is reasonable considering it provides a structural utility, a workstation, and a industry standard. And its considered cheaper then hiring a part time farm hand for what they offer.

Discounts may apply for:

- Multiple accounts (2 or more)
- Long-term contracts (2 or more years)
- Short-term service restrictions

Todd does not provide “small scale” or “new client” pricing, but notes that small scale farms do use Todd heavily.
